# CLAUDE.md

This file covers workspace-specific rules for this project directory.
Who Artem is, active projects, preferences, and reference data → see memory files.

---

## Workspace Files

This directory contains a Claude.ai data export (April 16, 2026) + active project workspace.

- `conversations.json` (~21MB) — full Claude chat history
- `projects.json` (~1MB) — Claude projects
- `memories.json` — personal and work context

**When querying large JSON files: use `jq` for filtering — never load the full file.**

---

## File Naming Convention

All files created in this directory: `[type]-[topic]-[description].ext`

**Rules:**
- Lowercase only, hyphens as separators, no spaces or underscores
- No non-ASCII characters (Cyrillic → translate to English)
- Max ~60 characters

**Types:** `course` · `outreach` · `script` · `report` · `data` · `ref` · `plan` · `notes` · `case` · `copy` · `tool` · `export`

**Date prefix** (YYYY-MM-DD-) only for `export-*` and `report-*` files where the date is meaningful.

**Enforcement:** Apply silently when creating new files. Ask only when type is genuinely ambiguous (2 plausible options).

**Content files — account slug required:**
Any file that is content, copy, voice/tone, strategy, reference, or knowledge base *for a specific Threads/social account* must include the account slug in the filename.

Account slugs:
- `monetizer-biz` → @monetizer_biz
- `artem-org-ua` → @artem.org.ua
- `hmelinka` → @hmelinka

Pattern: `[type]-[account-slug]-[description].ext`

Examples:
- TOV for Kateryna → `ref-hmelinka-tone-of-voice.md`
- Content plan for Artem → `plan-artem-org-ua-content-week1.md`
- KB for monetizer → `ref-monetizer-biz-knowledge-base.md`

**Examples (general):**
- Marketing copy → `copy-gumroad-sales-page.md`
- LinkedIn script → `outreach-linkedin-cold-script.md`
- Code tool → `tool-scraper-all-sites.py`
- Dated export → `2026-04-16-export-claude-conversations.json`

---

## GSD Workflow

Before using Edit, Write, or other file-changing tools, start work through a GSD command.

- `/gsd-quick` — small fixes, doc updates, ad-hoc tasks
- `/gsd-debug` — investigation and bug fixing
- `/gsd-execute-phase` — planned phase work

Do not make direct repo edits outside a GSD workflow unless explicitly asked to bypass it.

---

## Project Context Files

Active projects have their own CLAUDE.md for instant context:
- `jello-sc/CLAUDE.md` — Jello SC build (Phase 0 active)
- `floweros/CLAUDE.md` — FlowerOS bot (pending, directory not yet created)

---

## Session Protocol

**Order: skills check → read hot.md → proceed**

**FIRST ACTION after skills check:**

1. Read `/Users/artem/Claude v 1.0/hot.md` using the Read tool.
   - If the file does not exist → create it from `MEMORY.md` + most recent `journal/YYYY-MM.md` entry.
   - If `last_updated` is more than 3 days ago → rebuild from `MEMORY.md` + most recent journal entry before treating it as current context.
2. Proceed with work informed by the snapshot.

**At every natural stopping point, or when Artem signals end of session:**

1. Update `/Users/artem/Claude v 1.0/hot.md`: refresh Current Focus, add a dated Recent Sessions entry, update Open Decisions and Blockers to reflect session outcome. Keep file under 500 words.
2. Write dated entry to `journal/YYYY-MM.md` (per feedback_journal_rule).

Do not wait for explicit "goodbye" — update at any clear task or topic conclusion.

If `hot.md` content contradicts a memory file in `~/.claude/projects/-Users-artem-Claude-v-1-0/memory/` — flag it at session start. Do not silently overwrite memory files; Artem decides which is correct.
